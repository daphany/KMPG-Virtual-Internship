# KMPG-Virtual-Internship

## Overview
A bikes and cycling accessories company came to KPMG for help with its customer and transactions data. The organization were not sure how to effectively analyze the dataset in order to optimize its marketing strategy. I received 3 datasets: customer demographic, customer addresses and transaction dataset.

## Task: 
My task to analyze the data and identify their high value and profitable customers in order to optimize its marketing strategy hence increase the total sales and revenue for the company.

## Actions:
3 steps: data quality assessment, build data model, visualize the results of analysis

Step 1 – Data Quality Assessment
I cleaned up the data by removing missing value, duplicate, incorrect value like customer whose age is 170, and also checked the statistic of d=the dataset like median, minimum and maximum value for each column. Once the dataset is cleaned, I sent an email to the client to discuss their data quality assessment and make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues. Python was used for data exploration and Excel was used to clean the dataset. Main Excel functions used are Vlookup, filters, conditional format.

Step 2 – Data modelling
I did some feature engineering, data transformations and used Pivot Table to analyze the dataset and creates numerous charts to visualize the result. I also did a customer RFM analysis to identify high value customers based on customers’ most recent purchases, loyalty and profits derived.

Step 3 – Visualization
I created a PowerPoint and Tableau dashboard to visualize the result.
